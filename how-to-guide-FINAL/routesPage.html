            So, lets now add some more routes, for example lets add a route that will in future act as out capture form. Just copy the other route code, but change the “/” to “/captureForm” and delete all comments. Then, lets call the function something else, something like “server_captureForm():”. Then, after the return, type what ever you like, I typed “Hello, I am the capture form page!”. Now, reload the web page. Now, wait, why is that I am getting the message from a different app? Well, we need to access the code within the captureForm route, this can be done by typing in /captureForm after the URL for your web app, mine looks something like this: https://klych.pythonanywhere.com/captureForm, this is what I have:

            If you have the same, or something that you wrote, fantastic! If not, go back and read through again, you might have missed something.

            Okay, now as we have a route working, lets add some comments to the code.
        </div>

        <pre>
            <code>
                # A very simple Flask Hello World app for you to get started with...

                from flask import Flask #imports the Flask function from flask
                
                app = Flask(__name__) #Creates the flask app called app

                @app.route('/') #Defines the route at the default route
                def hello_world(): #Function that will run at the default route
                return 'Hello from Flask!' #Returns a message

                @app.route('/captureForm') #Defines the captureForm route
                def serve_captureForm(): #Function that will run at the /captureForm route
                    return "Hello, I am the capture form page!" #Returns a message
          </code>
        </pre>
