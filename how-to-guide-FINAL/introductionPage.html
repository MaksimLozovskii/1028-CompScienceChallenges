            <b>So, what is the PYJMAILER?</b>
             PYJMAILER is a python flask application with an HTML based capture form that captures user data from the page and stores it into a JSON file. The system then reads the JSON file per request and sends out an email to the provided email address.

        <div class="parag-2">
            Let’s break this down a bit – <b>what is Python?</b>
            Most of us will kind-of know what python is, python is a language used primarily for “scripting” – creating short programs which rapidly perform tasks. Python earned its name for being an easy language to learn due to its syntax, making it a perfect candidate to create out PYJMAILER.
        </div>
        <div class="parag-3">
            <b>Now what is Flask?</b>
            Flask, is framework written in python, which enables developers to communicate with web tools and create functionality for web-based apps.
        </div>
        <div class="parag-4">
            <b>What is SMTP?</b>
            SMTP or simple mail transfer protocol is a communications protocol used to transmit and receive mail over the internet. Python has an SMTP library which allows us to send emails using python code. To read more on STMP, have a look at RFC5321 (advanced).
        </div>
        <div class="parag-5">
            <b>And finally, what is JSON?</b>
            JSON is the holy grail of our application – an absolute blessing. Since I started learning JSON, I fell in love with it - It’s easy to learn, its fast, its reliable and works with almost any programming language. JSON, is an open interchange format that uses normal text to store and transmit data over the internet, goodbye XML hello JSON.
        </div>
        <div class="parag-6">
            <b>Now I will teach you how to create your own PYJMAILER and trick your dear friends and family members into giving you their email address, to which you can either send nice, automated emails in bulk or absolutely bombard them with spam – don’t do that)))</b>
        </div>
        <div class="parag-7">
            Before we will dive into the actual implementation, we need to get some things set-up, mainly we want a way to host the application, such as your PC as a home server or a hosting service that will host the files for you on their systems. The first method will require a little more technical skill, so I will stick with the second method.
