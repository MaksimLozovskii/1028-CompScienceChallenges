        <h2>Reflection of my experiences learning the following tech:</h2>
        <div>
            During the learning process of python flask and JSON, I have faced many different issues and challenges particularly because I did not really know what I was supposed to do. The best way to deal with such, is to have a solid plan of what I am going to do, such as, I require the system to take data, store data and send email using that data. 
        </div>

        <div>
            Already we have the input, the process, and the output. This makes the development process much easier, as you already know what result you are trying to achieve. With the technologies themselves, its not as easy. Before diving into anything, you must first know what alternatives exist, in this case, I couldâ€™ve used any other programming language or database to store the data, but for the purpose of this tutorial I chose the easiest technology to get started with and a have a result that is good enough to be shown to the public.

        <div>
            During the learning process, I mostly searched for use case type problems, such as, if I need to store data into JSON, I will search how to do just that, usually the result gets way more complicated (consists of many parts) and I proceed trying out each part until I get the result I want. Really, I found that the trial-and-error learning process worked the best for me, as you are not mindlessly learning a new technology, learning all the little detail about it, but you are getting knowledge during the development process, thus you learn how to solve problems and how to approach difficult situations. With that said, stack overflow worked wonders for me, abuse it).
